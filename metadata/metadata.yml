name: FEGC 1.0 (Flow Energy Gradient Calculator)
description: FEGC 1.0 is a specialized software tool developed to compute the energy
  gradient field and estimate the instability genesis locus from a velocity field
  of fluid flow. This software is grounded in the methodologies presented in our recent
  publication, where we demonstrated the derivation of the energy gradient from a
  velocity field and its application in determining the instability genesis locus
  in fluid flow. Our publication, "Derivation of Energy Gradient Function for Rayleigh-Taylor
  Instability," outlines the theoretical framework and numerical methods utilized
  in FEGC 1.0. By leveraging the principles discussed in the study, FEGC 1.0 offers
  a robust and efficient solution for analyzing fluid instability phenomena.
